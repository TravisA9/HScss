# HScss
Consume Scss in julia for your structured data needs

JSON is pretty much the first choice when storing structured data so why use Scss?

* Json is wastefull with its use of symbols.
* It is hard to read since both keys and values are highlighted as strings.
* It is also quite limited when it comes to power of expression.

Css is very expressive but lacks the ability to define structure.

On the other hand Scss has the best of both worlds. In theory it only was designed to add styling to web pages but if we don't limit ourselves to css' keywords you'll find that HyperScss is a great option for many structured data needs.

This project was thrown together in my free time durring a few days so it goes without saying that this is not at all a pollished project. If you would like to help out, you're sure welcome to.
